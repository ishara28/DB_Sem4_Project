        Lorem ipsum The UI/UX Design Specialization brings a design-centric
        approach to user interface and user experience design, and offers
        practical, skill-based instruction centered around a visual
        communications perspective, rather than on one focused on marketing or
        programming alone. In this sequence of four courses, you will summarize
        and demonstrate all stages of the UI/UX development process, from user
        research to defining a project’s strategy, scope, and information
        architecture, to developing sitemaps and wireframes. You’ll learn
        current best practices and conventions in UX design and apply them to
        create effective and compelling screen-based experiences for websites or
        apps.
